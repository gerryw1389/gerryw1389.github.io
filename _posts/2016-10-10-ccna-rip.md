#### Description:

RIP version 2 distributes the entire routing table every 30 seconds out 224.0.0.9

#### Setup RIPv2:

   ```tcl
   Router(config)#router rip
   Router(config-router)#version 2
   Router(config-router)#network 192.168.1.0
   Router(config-router)#network 10.0.1.0
   Router(config-router)#no auto-summary # tells it not to send summary messages
   Router(config-router)#default information originate # distributes default gateway
   Router(config-router)#passive-interface fa0/0 # use this command to set an interface you don't want to share details to.
   Router(config-router)#end
   Router#copy run start
   ```

#### Key points:

   - RIP uses hop counts to calculate optimal routes (a hop is a router).  
   - RIP routing is limited to 15 hops to any location (16 hops indicates the network is unreachable).  
   - RIP uses the split horizon with poison reverse method to prevent the count-to-infinity problem.  
   - RIP uses only classful routing, so it uses full address classes, not subnets.  
   - RIP broadcasts updates to the entire network.  
   - RIP can maintain up to six multiple paths to each network, but only if the cost is the same.  
   - RIP supports load balancing over same-cost paths.  
   - The update interval default is 30, the invalid timer default is 180, the holddown timer default is 180, and the flush timer default is 240.
