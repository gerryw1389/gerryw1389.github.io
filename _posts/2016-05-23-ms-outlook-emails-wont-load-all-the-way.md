### Description:

If you can send and receive emails but they are not complete, try these steps.

### To Resolve:

1. Try using the ScanPST tool for Outlook in &#8220;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\OFFICE12&#8221; or something similar.

2. Check and see if there are any rules that need to be changed. Depending on the version, they will be located in different options. Remove them and re-add them one by one.
