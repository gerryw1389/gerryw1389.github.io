### Description:

Many applications are still not able to communicate effectively through MS Office 64 bit. You will need to uninstall and reinstall the 32 bit version.

### To Resolve:

1. Find the product key for MS Office. Use a keyfinder application if needed. Note: If you can find the installer and you have the product key, just uninstall office and navigate to the &#8220;x86&#8221; folder and run `setup.exe` from there.

2. Enter the key at : [https://downloadoffice.getmicrosoftkey.com/](https://setup.office.com/downloadoffice/)

3. Create an account and download the file. The installer is tailored to a specific product key so it's not a general installer. It installs Office 32b by default.

4. After you install it, you will most likely need to call the MS number to reactive office. Make sure to say &#8220;One&#8221; when it asks how many times it's been installed.
