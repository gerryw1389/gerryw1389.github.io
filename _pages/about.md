Hello, my name is Gerry and I currently work as a Senior Automation Engineer at an enterprise company in the DFW Area (TX). My current focus is on automation using enterprise software applications and workflows. This blog serves as a place to store and search my lessons learned over time.

### My Interests Over Time:

1. Automation Engineer (current):
   - Azure, Github, Docker, Python, Ansible
   - I'm trying to be serverless as much as possible so I use Azure Functions and Azure Containers when possible
      - See my [Azure](https://automationadmin.com/categories/#azure) category and [cloud](https://automationadmin.com/tags/#cloud) tag for example 
   - Try to check the skills in: [How to be a Cloud SysAdmin](https://automationadmin.com/2018/11/aws-sysadmin-guide/)
   - Must read [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/cdlar7/psa_still_not_automating_still_at_risk/)

2. Systems Administrator:
   - Powershell, Windows Server
   - I was a Windows SysAdmin but tried at every job to use Linux instead (where it makes sense (not for Active Directory for example)):
      - [How to be a Linux SysAdmin](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/how-to-become-a-linux-sysadmin/)  
      - [How to be a Windows SysAdmin](https://automationadmin.com/2016/06/how-to-be-a-windows-sysadmin/) 
   - Having trouble breaking in? See [this post](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/breaking-into-sa-jobs/)

3. Remote Support Tech:
   - Mostly break fix and learning to script
   - Learn to troubleshoot
   - Everyone should read this at [the beginning of your career](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) and really understand what it is saying. This is not to be condescending, but I refuse to help people who do not try to help themselves. 80% of people who ask me questions about something are doing it out of sheer laziness - no more, redirect them to this page and ask them "show me where you got stuck..."

4. How to Advance:
   - Look for a [new demanding job](https://thedailywtf.com/articles/Up-or-Out-Solving-the-IT-Turnover-Crisis) once you feel you have learned all you can and you don't see upwards mobility
     - Make sure to [interview them](https://automationadmin.com/2016/04/interview-questions/) more than they interview you :)
     - Try to give your current position 3 years, it can look bad if you jump ship too often.
   - Try to never be the smartest person the room
   - Be a tinker by nature:
     - When you install programs, do you modify the themes, settings, sync options, encryption options? See my [tweaks](https://automationadmin.com/tags/#tweaks) tag for example. Drives me crazy that people install vscode and don't know about `settings.json` [tweaks and extensions](https://gist.github.com/gerryw1389/ad275818cb8ffc3a7efb8795a85e7080#file-vscode-settings-json).
     - Do you regularly go out of your way to learn how $x works? See [this list](https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted) of things you can install in your [homelab](https://automationadmin.com/tags/#test-lab)
       - See my [setup](https://automationadmin.com/tags/#setup) tag for example
       - After you stand something up, take notes of each step and then post them on [a blog](https://automationadmin.com/2019/06/wordpress-to-jekyll/) so you can showcase your skills.
         - This can be a self hosted Wordpress instance or preferably, Github Pages with many blog links pointing to your Github repos.
     - Last but not least, focus mostly on [scripting](https://automationadmin.com/2020/02/importance-of-learning-scripting/). I would do powershell for Windows and bash/python for linux servers.
       - I always explain scripting to be like legos - Super small chunks of things that you learn that build the foundation for any kind of automation you can think of. For example, see [this post](https://automationadmin.com/2018/02/new-to-powershell/)
       - You will never not have an in-demand job if you know how to write scripts, especially if built on a SysAdmin foundational knowledge (how to build servers, how to [picture networking](https://automationadmin.com/2020/08/basic-network-troubleshooting), how to use [orchestration tools](https://automationadmin.com/tags/#orchestration) for example)
   - Work on your [people skills](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/people-skills/) yo!
