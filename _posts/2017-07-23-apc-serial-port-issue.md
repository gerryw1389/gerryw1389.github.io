### Description:

Found an issue with APC Battery backups and serial connectors. Turns out that their serial cards non-standard and are only supposed to be used with an APC provided adapter. If you plug in a regular serial cord, they shut down completely!

### To Resolve:

1. Save their special adapter and only use it if you ever need to use the serial card connector.
