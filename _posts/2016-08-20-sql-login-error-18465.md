### Description:

We once had to create a database on our MS SQL Server to sync with a third party site to share data between companies. In the process, I created them some SQL users in the database, but they were having issues logging in. They would get an `Error: 18456` when attempting.

### To Resolve:

1. Although I could've sworn I put it in mixed Authentication mode, the server was in `Windows Authentication Mode` which doesn't allow SQL user logins. To fix it you just login to SSMS, right click on the server => Properties => Security => and select the `SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode` radio option.

2. Run => `services.msc` => SQL Server Service => Restart. 

   - The service name may be the name of your instance.
