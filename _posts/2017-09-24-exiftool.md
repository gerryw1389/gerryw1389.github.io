### Description:

[Exiftool](https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) is a neat little command line program I use to view/edit media files. Here are some batch scripts I use with it to &#8220;clean&#8221; media that I get from the intertubes. What this does is strip all metadata information from the files like geo locations for photos from cell phone pics or miscellaneous information on movies and replaces it with your own copyright. I use this tool in combination with Media Monkey for much of my media collection.

### To Resolve:

1. Copy the executable and create a batch file to a folder. In the batch file paste:

   - For Photos:

   ```powershell
   G:\tasks\pics\exiftool.exe -overwrite_original -P "-FileModifyDate<XMP:DateTimeOriginal" "-FileModifyDate<EXIF:CreateDate" "-FileModifyDate<XMP:CreateDate" "-FileModifyDate<$IPTC:DateCreated $IPTC:TimeCreated" "-FileModifyDate<EXIF:DateTimeOriginal" -all= -copyright="Gerry Williams" *.jpg *.JPG *.jpeg *.JPEG
   pause
   exit
   ```

   - For Movies:

   ```powershell
   G:\tasks\movies\exiftool.exe -overwrite_original -all= -copyright="Gerry Williams, all rights reserved" -rights="Gerry Williams, all rights reserved" -CopyrightNotice="Gerry Williams, all rights reserved" *.mp4 *MP4
   echo completed
   pause
   exit
   ```

2. Another example of media files formatting is my [Bulk Rotate](https://automationadmin.com/2018/08/use-ps-ffmpeg-to-bulk-rotate-movies/) post.
