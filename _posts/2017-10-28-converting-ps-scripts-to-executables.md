### Description:

If you ever want to convert a script to an executable, there is a script for that! I personally avoid this route because AV Software likes to block unknown executables (as it should) and I just use powershell scripts with [launcher batch files](https://automationadmin.com/2017/03/ps-call-ps1-with-batch/).
