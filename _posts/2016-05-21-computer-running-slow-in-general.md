### Description:

The computer will be slow overall, not just on the internet or inside of any specific software.

### To Resolve:

1. Run CCleaner and TFC (Temp File Cleaner). Is there plenty of space available? Open &#8220;My Computer&#8221; and check.

2. Run a chkdsk on your OS drive. Many times you may have a HDD that is starting to fail.

3. Most of the time this is a common sign of a virus, I recommend you scan with MalwareBytes AntiRootkit and then MalwareBytes Regular (MBAR and MBAM).
