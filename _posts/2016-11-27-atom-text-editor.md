### Description:

So I have been using Notepad++ for a while, but I went searching for alternatives the other day and found Atom. I'm not a programmer by any means, but I really just &#8220;clicked&#8221; with this software so I thought I could use a page of notes for myself on this (unless you find anything useful here).

### To Resolve:

1. Install [Atom portable](https://github.com/garethflowers/atom-portable) at C:\Google\Scripts

2. Go to Settings and change:

   - Themes = Atom dark for UI and One Light for the text editor
   - System = Register as file handler. I right clicked .txt and .ps1 one files and set Atom as the default viewer for these.
   - Packages = Disable &#8220;wrap-guide&#8221; to get rid of the vertical line. Installed &#8220;language-powershell&#8221; so that it can recognize PS input. Installed &#8220;highlight-line&#8221; and set background color to &#8220;153, 255, 153&#8221; in style.css file.

   - Editor = Set tab length to 4 spaces.
   - Core = Set &#8220;project home&#8221; to c:\Google\Scripts
   - Need to learn Keyboard Shortcuts:

     - ctrl + o = opens a file  
     - ctrl + shift + o = Opens a directory in the directory tree  
     - ctrl + n = for new file  
     - ctrl + shift + o = for opening a folder  
     - ctrl + t = opens a file in your project  
     - ctrl + shift + l = Sets the language (need to find a way to set default)
