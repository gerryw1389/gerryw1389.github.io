### Description:

I had an issue where my Dell U3419W monitor would show windows side by side easily, but it was a huge pain to share my screen during collaboration sessions which I needed to do often. What I needed was software to split my screen into two monitors

### To Resolve:

1. So I originally had just a single USB-C connecting to my laptop, the fix was to add a HDMI from the screen to my laptop and:
   - Download/Run Dell Display Manager
     - Go to input - Main Window #1 = USB-C / Sub Window #2 = HDMI#1
   - In addition, use Intel HD Graphics Control panel to set each window to `1720*1440` and `Scale Full Screen` (under Display)
