### Description:

I'm an avid [`Run`](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/command-prompt-overview/) user, I use it all the time with a [list of common shortcuts](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/keyboard-shortcuts-and-run-commands-use-them/) in Windows. One thing I try to do is add programs I use often to the list.

### To Resolve:

1. To add a program to the list, right click and send a shortcut to the desktop.

2. Rename the shortcut to whatever you want, just make sure it doesn't exist already in C:\Windows.

3. Cut and paste the shortcut to C:\Windows.

Alternatively, you can dig in the registry or modify your %PATH% variable, but this is by far the quickest and easiest way. NOTE: Requires Admin access.
