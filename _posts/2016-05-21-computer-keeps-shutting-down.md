### Description:

Computer will shut down completely for no known reason. Nothing in `eventvwr.msc` shows anything suspicious leading up to the &#8220;Kernel-Power&#8221; critical errors.

### To Resolve:

1. Check the power connections. Is the computer plugged directly into the wall? Power strip? Try bypassing if so, may be a defective power strip.

2. Shut the computer down and drain the residual power (See [&#8220;The Dell Fix&#8221; For Fan Failures/ Controller Errors](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/the-dell-fix-for-fancontroller-errors/)) and start diagnostics. If no troubles are detected, call the manufacturer and let them investigate, it's most likely going to be a power supply or faulty motherboard.

3. Check to see if the computer has all of it's hardware drivers up-to-date. Sometimes a new HDD firmware update may be the culprit.
