### Description:

In order to schedule a meeting in IMeet, the client will need to have the &#8220;IMeet Outlook Plugin&#8221; installed on their machine.

### To Resolve:

1. Open Outlook and go to the Imeet Tab.

2. Select &#8220;Settings&#8221; and then Sign In. Make sure on the account that will host the meeting.

3. Once signed in, go to &#8220;Schedule Meeting&#8221; and then Meet Later. This creates a calendar entry for a person.

4. Send the email. It will have a link for attendees to join. Done.

### What If You Want To Add A Room Key?

1. Open the client application and start the meeting.

2. Go to settings on the bottom right and generate a &#8220;room key&#8221;.

3. Then go to Outlook on the calendar tab and open the appointment that you scheduled. Change what you need to on it, such as adding the line: &#8220;**New Room Key: xxxxx**&#8220;, and then select &#8220;Send Update&#8221;.

4. Now, attendees can join the meeting with a new passcode.
