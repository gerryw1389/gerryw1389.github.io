### Description:

The error will say &#8220;The IPMI device driver attempted to communicate with the IPMI BMC device during normal operation. However the communication failed due to a timeout. You can increase the timeouts associated with the IPMI device driver.&#8221; This is associated with a Baseboard Management Controller from Dell.

### To Resolve:

1. Run => `devmgmt.msc` => show hidden devices.

2. Navigate to System Devices => Microsoft Generic IPMI Compliant Device and see if there is a warning.

3. Download a new driver if needed.
