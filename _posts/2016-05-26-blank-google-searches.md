### Description:

Google Instant Search will be returning blank pages in from google.com searches. Ironically, if you have it configured as a search provider, all searches in the URL bar will return results just not from Google.com. I haven't had any issues on Chrome on my computer, but some have who use IE. Follow these steps to try and resolve:

### To Resolve:

1. [Run =>](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/command-prompt-overview/) `inetcpl.cpl` => Delete cookies/cache from General tab.

2. If you put Google.com in compatibility view, this seems to resolve the error.
