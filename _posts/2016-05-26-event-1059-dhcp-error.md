### Description:

After I installed a new DC and gave it the AD DS, DHCP, and DNS roles I let it sit for a couple days to replicate. I ran into the issue where I had set the server's IP static and it caused the DHCP to bind to the NIC when it shouldn't have which generated all these 1059 error's.

### To Resolve:

1. If you get this error, open up DHCP => Right Click (ServerName) => Add/Remove Bindings => Uncheck your server's IP address.

2. [run => cmd => ](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/command-prompt-overview/) `net stop dhcp && net start dhcp`
