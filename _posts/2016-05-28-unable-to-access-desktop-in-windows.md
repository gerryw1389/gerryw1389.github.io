### Description:

Upon entering your credentials to login to Windows, some screen will prevent you from accessing your desktop. Most common is just a black screen with nothing accessible.

### To Resolve:

1. Always try to bring up the Task Manager using the shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+ESC. If you can, you can select &#8220;File => New Task(Run)&#8221; and then choose &#8220;explorer.exe&#8221; to bring up the desktop.

2. You can also try running &#8220;cmd&#8221; and then type &#8220;rstrui.exe&#8221; in the Command Prompt.

3. If you are unable to open the Task Manager and you have verified that the keyboard is connected good, try and access Safe Mode with Networking or run Hardware Diagnostics to make sure your HDD with the OS is not faulty.
