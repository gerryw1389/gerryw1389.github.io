### Description:

As most people in IT, I created a test lab environment to learn more about domains once I landed my first Sys Admin job. To do this:

I have a custom built PC with 32GB of Ram and an I7-4770K processor with 4 TB of storage as the host machine (W7x64b).  
I have VMWare Workstation v10 installed.  
I have 8 VM's: Two Windows Server 2012's, Two Windows Server 2008r2, two Windows 10 preview VMs, and two Windows 7 VMs.

### To Resolve:

1. Did the steps in &#8220;[Virtual Network](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/test-lab-virtual-network/)&#8220;. Wanted to learn how to create a network in VMWare Worsktation.

2. Did the steps in &#8220;[Domain](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/test-lab-domain-setup/)&#8220;. Learned how to setup a domain controller and enable the AD DS, DHCP, and DNS roles in Windows Server 2012.
