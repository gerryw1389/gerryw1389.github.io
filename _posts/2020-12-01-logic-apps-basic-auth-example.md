### Description:

In this example, I use Logic Apps to reach out to a Service Now instance using Basic Auth. This is kind of old as we use Oauth now, but the example can still be useful!

### To Resolve:

1. Source code is [here](https://github.com/gerryw1389/gerryw1389.github.io/blob/main/assets/code/logic-apps/basic-auth-example-read-sn.json)

2. Be sure to find/replace for `{{ some text }}` to set your own values. Also keep in mind I had to make many changes to sanitize it so it is just a general idea of how the Logic App will work, you might have to tweak it.
