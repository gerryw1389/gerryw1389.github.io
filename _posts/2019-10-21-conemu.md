### Description:

[Conemu](https://conemu.github.io/) has been my go-to program the last year due to the need to have all terminals in one application. It allows you to have a standard interface for accessing:
   - Command Prompt
   - Powershell
   - Windows Subsystem For Linux

### To Resolve:

1. Download and copy the portable version to my google drive.

2. Create a Quick Launch shortcut on my taskbar that points to my Google Drive version of the app.

3. Use the `conemu.xml` file to sync settings between work and home PC. Currently a group of settings with the `Babun` color theme.
