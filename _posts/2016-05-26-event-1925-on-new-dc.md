### Description:

After joining our new Server2012r2 VM to the domain I let it replicate for a couple days. I then found an issue with Windows Time:

### To Resolve:

1. As standard practice, I opened Event Viewer => Custom => Server Roles => AD DS => and looked for errors. There were multiple &#8220;Event 1925&#8221; logged and it showed to be happening between one of the member DC's and my newly joined DC. MS Support site gave [basic troubleshooting](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc949135(v=ws.10).aspx), but it didn't really help at all.

2. [run => cmd => ](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/command-prompt-overview/) `repadmin /showrepl /errorsonly`. This revealed something about the time being off between DC's.

3. On the PDC Emulator, [run => cmd => ](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/command-prompt-overview/)`w32tm /query /status`. Here you take note of the IP address of your time source.

4. On the PDC Emulator, [run => cmd => ](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/command-prompt-overview/)`w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:timeserver /syncfromflags:manual /reliable:yes /update` 
   
   - Where timeserver is a space delimited list of your time source servers

5. On the PDC Emulator, [run => cmd => ](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/command-prompt-overview/)`net stop w32time && net start w32time`

6. On each member DC, [run => cmd => ](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/command-prompt-overview/)`w32tm /config /syncfromflags:domhier /update`

7. On each member DC, [run => cmd => ](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/command-prompt-overview/)`net stop w32time && net start w32time`

8. This worked great on the other DC's, but my newly joined DC kept reverting the time. I researched this a little bit and found:

   - Open up Hyper-V Manager => Navigate to the VM => Right Click => Settings => Integration Services => Uncheck &#8220;Time Synchronization&#8221;.

   NOTE: I did the default install of Windows Server 2012r2 and I don't recall there being an option to configure your local time in the install (I might have breezed by it), but it was set to Pacific by default and I am in the Central Time Zone. So I manually set the host and all of it's VM's to the correct time after this.
   {: .notice--success}

1.  Manually set the DC to the correct time zone/time and it will work from here on out.
