### Description:

Inspired by [ISO 8601](https://xkcd.com/1179/), I thought I could re-iterate what others are saying about standardizing dates. I have been using this method for a couple years now and have since transformed my entire workflows around using dates in this format.

### To Resolve:

1. For example, a common folder on my computer will look like:

   <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5324" src="https://automationadmin.com/assets/images/uploads/2018/04/dates.png" alt="" width="628" height="418" srcset="https://automationadmin.com/assets/images/uploads/2018/04/dates.png 628w, https://automationadmin.com/assets/images/uploads/2018/04/dates-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /> 

2. Imagine how easy it is to search for something?

   <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5325" src="https://automationadmin.com/assets/images/uploads/2018/04/dates2.png" alt="" width="728" height="518" srcset="https://automationadmin.com/assets/images/uploads/2018/04/dates2.png 728w, https://automationadmin.com/assets/images/uploads/2018/04/dates2-300x213.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /> 

3. Next time someone uses a date in a different format, link them to this page or the XKCD in the description. Or, just send them this bit of PS to run:

   ```powershell
   [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = "Tls12, Tls11, Tls, Ssl3";
   (Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'https://xkcd.com/1179/info.0.json' -Method Get | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Transcript).subString(0,238)
   ```
