### Description:

Over the years I have bounced around different organizers such as TreeNotesDB, OneNote, CherryTree, GoogleDocs, etc. This is my settings for CherryTree:

### To Resolve:

1. Open up preferences and configure:

   Text and code:  
   Uncheck Automatic indentation

   Rich Text:  
   Custom Background => #CCFFCC and #0B0909  
   2017-08-21: Changed to #0BAF0B => green / #2A2828 => grey and #06FAED for links  
   Miscellaneous = Uncheck show white spaces and highlight current line

   Plain Text and Code:  
   Style Scheme => Oblivion  
   Uncheck show white spaces and highlight current line

   Tree1:  
   Custom Background => #0B0909 and #CCFFCC  
   Use selected icon = terminal  
   Nodes on startup = expand all

   Tree2:  
   Tree Nodes Names Wrapping Width = 200

   Fonts:  
   Change all to verdana, normal, 12  
   Linux = Waree Book 12

   Links:  
   Change all four to equal #058200

   Miscellaneous:  
   Saving => Check Autosave every 10 minutes and autosave on quit. Uncheck the Create backup copy  
   Misc => Uncheck all three options

   Finally, go to View => Show/Hide Node Name Header to turn it off.

### Themes:

1. So what you do is just switch so the contrast is the opposite between Rich text node and the tree node. 

   - Light green and black:  
     - Green (Rich Text) => #CCFFCC  
     - Black (Tree background) => #0B0909
   - Another green and black:  
     - Green (Rich Text) => #618B61
     - Black (Tree background) => #1D1D1D  
   - Favorite So Far:  
     - Green (Rich Text) => #23B14D
     - Black (Tree background) => #272526  
   - Obsidian:
     - Gray  (Rich Text) => #E0E2E4
     - Black (Tree background) => #293134
