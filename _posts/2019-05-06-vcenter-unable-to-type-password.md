### Description:

So using the HTML5 version of vCenter sometimes will work, sometimes won't. The one way I've gotten around passwords not working is by using the client (VMRC).

### To Resolve:

1. I found this out because I kept getting `login incorrect` as seen below:

2. Which worked fine when I used the console to connect:
