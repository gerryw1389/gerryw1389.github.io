### Description:

Before asking for help, make sure you are someone worth helping.  
Be sure to read [this text](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#rtfm) and direct others to do the same in your organization.

### To Resolve:

1. Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list you plan to post to.

2. Try to find an answer by searching the Web.

3. Try to find an answer by reading the manual.

4. Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.

5. If you still cannot find your answer, then ask. Of course if you are confused about the answer, point a link to your reference in your question.

   - Example: &#8220;Need help finding out how to add a user in active directory. I have searched (&#8220;weblink&#8221;) and referenced a couple of previously posted articles (&#8220;weblink to article(s)&#8221;) and found this article helpful (&#8220;weblink&#8221;), but I still cannot figure out which OU I should click on ADUC. Please advise.&#8221;
