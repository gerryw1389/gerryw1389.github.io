### Description:

If you ever get a open file dialog that points to your &#8220;Libraries&#8221; folder, you could change the default path in a few simple steps.

### To Resolve:

1. Locate the folder icon on the Windows task bar.

2. Right Click => Windows Explorer => Right Click => Properties. This will have the default value of `%windir%\explorer.exe`.

3. Change that value to whatever directory you want. I prefer `C:\` since I do not store anything in the Windows User Documents folder, but instead in my own folder on the root of the C drive.

### To Change The Default Save Location:

1. Open up &#8220;My Computer&#8221; (Win+E).

2. Navigate to &#8220;Libraries&#8221; in the tree on the left.

3. Right click => properties => change path's and folders to what you want.

4. If you have a &#8220;Google Drive&#8221;, &#8220;MediaFire&#8221;, or &#8220;DropBox&#8221; folder, you can select that as a default save location or select a folder of your choosing.
