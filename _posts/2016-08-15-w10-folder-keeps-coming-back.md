### Description:

I had an issue once where I would delete a folder and it kept coming back! It was a pictures folder that I had transferred from my mom's phone to add to our shared storage.

### To Resolve:

1. Open `%Appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Libraries`

2. Right click the CameraRoll folder properties. Remove the directory. I guess Windows thought that was going to be my go-to folder for pictures or something.
