### Description:

User will send a request saying they are not receiving emails from one client. All other emails work fine (They can even send to that client).

### To Resolve:

1. Login to their computer.

2. Have them login to their webmail and go to Settings => Options => Mail => Blacklist.

3. More often than not, that persons email will be in there. How it gets there, I don't know. Many claim it's a glitch (Google it) but by removing it, the issue will be resolved.
