### Description:

I have only tested this on Powerpoint, but I read that it works on other files as well. Essentially, if you get a file with a lot of pictures and you want to extract them easily, follow this method to either delete the files to shrink the file size, or extract them separately:

### To Resolve:

1. Run => `control folders` => Show file extensions

2. Make a copy of the file in case you mess it up beyond repair.

3. Rename the file extension to `.zip`

5. Delete the files in the "embedded" folder.

6. Rename extension back to `.pptx`

7. Open the file.
