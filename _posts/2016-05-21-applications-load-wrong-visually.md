### Description:

When you open multiple windows and they don't look as they should (laggy) or don't load all the way, this is a typical sign of a video driver issue.

### To Resolve:

1. [Run =>](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/command-prompt-overview/) `devmgmt.msc` => Check the display drivers. Select the option to update the driver.

2. Check the hardware manufacturers website and download the display adapter for the model of the workstation.

3. Install the driver and reboot.
