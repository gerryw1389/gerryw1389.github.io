### Description:

We wanted to find a way to lock the screen's after 10 minutes of inactivity. This is how to do it:  
NOTE:Â If You Have All W8/Server2012+ Clients:

`Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\Interactive logon`: Machine inactivity limit

Windows notices inactivity of a logon session, and if the amount of inactive time exceeds the inactivity limit, then the screen saver will run, locking the session.

### To Resolve:

1. Create A GPO Under The OU With All Your Users And Go To:

   - `User Configuration\Administrative templates\Control Panel\Personalize`:
   - Enable Screensaver = Enabled
   - Password Protect The Screen Saver = Enabled
   - Screen Saver Timeout = Enabled
   - Force Specific Screen Saver = Enabled
     - Options: type `%windir%\system32\rundll32.exe user32.dll,LockWorkStation`
     - So it will lock the desktop once it reach the specified timeout.
