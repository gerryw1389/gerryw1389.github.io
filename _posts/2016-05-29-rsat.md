5. My computer is on the domain, but I am not logged in as the domain admin. In order run RSAT, I had to modify the target path to run as the domain admin:

   - Start => Administrative Tools => Server Manager => Right Click Properties => Target: `C:\Windows\System32\runas.exe /user:account@domain.name 'mmc %SystemRoot%\system32\ServerManager.msc /domain=domain.name'`

6. Now I just open up Server Manager => It prompts for domain admin password, then it launches Server Manager. I then Right Click &#8220;Server Manager&#8221; => Connect to a remote computer => &#8220;ComputerName&#8221; => and it connects!

7. You will have to do step 5 for each tool you installed. You will modify the `%SystemRoot%\system32\ServerManager.msc` to point to that modules path.
