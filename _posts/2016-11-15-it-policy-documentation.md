2. Once you get these documents, go through each document and replace with details for your environment (after getting management on board of course! See first section)

3. After you write out the policies, you have to enforce them and have at least 6 months of logs auditing your environment. Feel free to add/ take away as this is just a template.

4. Lastly, you can pay a third party contractor to come audit your department every X months as your policies dictate. If you are looking to get ISO certified, there may be more steps involved.
