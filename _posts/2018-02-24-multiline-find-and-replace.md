### Description:

Follow this post to use multi line find and replace. I find this especially helpful when editing header parts of my scripts on Github or batch editing of any kind for that matter.


### To Resolve:

1. Download and install Notepad Plus Plus.

2. Download and install [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/bruderstein/nppPluginManager/releases) (UNI for x32 and x64 for x64, you will want the 32 bit even if you are on 64bit machine)

3. Add the [Toolbucket Plugin](http://phdesign.com.au/npptoolbucket/)

   NOTE: For both of these, you just copy the DLL's directly into the NPP Plugins directory at C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\plugins  
   Also, restart NPP if you had it open.
   {: .notice--success}

4. Open all your PS1 Files and drag them to a blank NPP window

5. Do the actual MultiLine Find and Replace by going to Plugins => Toolbucket => MultiLine Find and Replace (Alt+Shift+F)
