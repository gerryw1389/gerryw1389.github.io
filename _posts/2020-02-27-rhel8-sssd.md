### Description:

Here are the steps I did recently to configure SSSD on a RHEL 8 box I deployed in Azure.

### To Resolve:

1. Join realm :

   ```shell
   # Install key components required to make joining to the domain and access control work:
   yum install realmd oddjob oddjob-mkhomedir sssd adcli -y
   # Join to company domain:
   realm join company.com -U myADAccount
   ```

   - Overwrite the `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf file` to include the following: 

   ```escape
   [sssd]
   domains = domain.com
   config_file_version = 2
   services = nss, pam
   [domain/domain.com]
   access_provider = simple
   ad_domain = domain.com
   auth_provider = ad
   auto_private_groups = true
   cache_credentials = True
   case_sensitive = true
   debug_level = 9
   default_shell = /bin/bash
   override_homedir = /home/%u
   id_provider = ad
   krb5_realm = domain.com
   krb5_store_password_if_offline = True
   ldap_id_mapping = False
   ldap_use_tokengroups = False
   realmd_tags = manages-system joined-with-samba
   use_fully_qualified_names = False
   ```

   - Now continue: `vi /etc/sssd/conf.d/default.conf`

   ```escape
   [domain/domain.com]
   simple_allow_groups = thisRHEL8Server.domain.com Administrators
   ```

   - This file can include multiple groups as comma-separated values. The group(s) must exist in AD and have a GID assigned. Users within the group also require a GID and UID populated.
   - If the AD groups contains a space, enter the group as-is from AD.

2. Create the group 'thisRHEL8Server.domain.com Administrators' in Active Directory and move the computer object from the previous step to the correct OU if you need to.

3. Add to sudoers. Type `visudo` and scroll down to the `%wheel` line and insert the group from above:

   ```escape
   ## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
   %wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL
   %thisRHEL8Server.domain.com\ Administrators      ALL=(ALL)       ALL
   ```

   - or

   ```escape
   echo "%thisRHEL8Server.domain.com\ administrators  ALL=(ALL)  ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/thisRHEL8Server
   visudo -cf /etc/sudoers.d/thisRHEL8Server
   ```
   
4. Clean up changes to SSSD and reboot

   ```shell
   sss_cache -E
   systemctl stop sssd
   rm -rf /var/lib/sss/db/*
   reboot
   ```

5. In general, if you ever make changes to SSD, you need to run the following:

   ```shell
   sss_cache -E
   systemctl stop sssd
   rm -rf /var/lib/sss/db/*
   systemctl start sssd
   ```

6. Troubleshooting topics:

   - In Active Directory, be sure to set `gidnumber` for the administrators group mentioned above.
   - If possible, remove nested groups. This hasn't been tested well, but with many of our servers it is much easier to manage SSSD when the AD groups don't have nested groups.
   - For each member in AD group, make sure they have a `gidnumber` and `uidnumber` AD attribute assigned and that they are DIFFERENT.
   - On server run: `id aduser` and `getent group "ad-group-name"` and evaluate their outputs to see if SSSD can see the groups.
