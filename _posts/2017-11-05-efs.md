### To Resolve:

1. Check Windows Explorer and you will see padlock icons on the files, this means the files are individually encrypted using EFS

   - You can see this in the parent folder's properties:

2. You will need to uncheck the box and follow the prompts for un-encrypting the data. You may not find this as often anymore and most people moved on Bitlocker.
