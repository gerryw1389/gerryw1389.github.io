### Description:

There will be a yellow warning triangle on the &#8220;Network Connections&#8221; icon on the system tray.

### To Resolve:

1. Enable IPv6 in the Local Area Connection Properties.

2. Could also represent a DNS issue, make sure the computer is on DHCP or pointing to the correct DNS.
