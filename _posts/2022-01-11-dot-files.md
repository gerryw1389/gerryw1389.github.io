### Description:

I was going through my blog and noticed that I write about setting up new computers a lot but failed to mention "dot files". Dot Files are files on a linux computer under your user profile folder `~` or `/home/gerry` for example that start with a dot and then a name. For example, `.vimrc` or `.bashrc`. These files are meant to configure system shells or systems executables like `bash`, `vi` or `ksh`. Many users will pull their dot files from a central location if they are building/destroying machines often.

### To Resolve:

1. I have moved mine to [here](https://github.com/gerryw1389/misc/tree/main/dot-files) for the public facing stuff and keep my personal ones on my Google Drive.

1. When setting up a new computer, I like to document each step I take in hopes of automating it one day. With powershell/bash/python, this is much easier than you might imagine. For now, I keep many of my settings in that repo on Github, but in the future I plan to use [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) or [Ansible](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible) in conjunction with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for the quick provisioning of new systems.
