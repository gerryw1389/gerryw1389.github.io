Hello, my name is Gerry and I currently work as a Cloud Systems Engineer at an enterprise company. My current focus is leveraging Infrastruce As Code (IaC) to deploy resources into Azure by utilizing multi-step Pipelines to accomplish this. In addition, I like to leverage any technologies for automation with powershell or python. This blog serves as a place to store and search my lessons learned over time, maybe you can find it helpful as well.

### My Interests Over Time:

1. Cloud Systems Engineer (current):
   - Daily tools used: 
     - Deploying of all Azure Services using Azure Devops/Github Actions + Terraform. Everything is done through IaC instead of Azure Portal. Challenge mode on!
     - AKS deployment/management. Will post more on this in the future but for now just learning how to use [kubectl and k9s](https://automationadmin.com//2022/07/kubectl-k9s) for interacting with deployed clusters. Stay tuned.
     - Powershell + Python scripting to be ran by Azure Automation/Logic Apps/Function Apps. This will never change as scripting is an [incredibly valuable skill](https://automationadmin.com/2020/02/importance-of-learning-scripting/) that can be used anywhere/anytime for automation.
   - So instead of using the Azure portal to deploy serverless applications, I now mostly write them in Terraform and deploy with Azure Devops.
   - In previous positions, I always [source controlled](https://automationadmin.com/tags/#versioncontrol) what I could so this is just the next logical step.

1. Automation Engineer:
   - Azure, Github, Docker, Python, Ansible
   - I'm trying to be serverless as much as possible so I use Azure Functions and Azure Containers when possible
     - See my [Azure](https://automationadmin.com/categories/#azure) category and [cloud](https://automationadmin.com/tags/#cloud) tag for example.
   - Try to check the skills in: [How to be a Cloud SysAdmin](https://automationadmin.com/2018/11/aws-sysadmin-guide/)
   - Must read [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/cdlar7/psa_still_not_automating_still_at_risk/)
   - Trying to [break in?](https://roadmap.sh/devops) Get to learning. More info can be found on [this recurring thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/koijyu/monthly_getting_into_devops_thread_202101/)
   - Most common tags for 2021 so far:

     - [Scripting-RestAPI](https://automationadmin.com/tags/#scripting-restapi)
     - [VersionControl](https://automationadmin.com/tags/#versioncontrol)

2. Systems Administrator:
   - Powershell, Windows Server
   - I was a Windows SysAdmin but tried at every job to use Linux instead (where it makes sense (not for Active Directory for example)):
     - [How to be a Linux SysAdmin](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/how-to-become-a-linux-sysadmin/)  
     - [How to be a Windows SysAdmin](https://automationadmin.com/2016/06/how-to-be-a-windows-sysadmin/)
   - Having trouble breaking in? See [this post](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/breaking-into-sa-jobs/)
   - Already in? [how far in?](https://www.docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FBr20VIOePQH2aAH2a_6irvdB1NOTHZaD8U5e2MOMiw/pub?output=html) Please don't be cocky, read [the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/wiki/bootcamp/) to always improve your skills.

3. Remote Support Tech:
   - Mostly break fix and learning to script
   - Learn to troubleshoot
   - Everyone should read this at [the beginning of your career](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) and really understand what it is saying. This is not to be condescending, but I refuse to help people who do not try to help themselves. 80% of people who ask me questions about something are doing it out of sheer laziness - no more, redirect them to this page and ask them "show me where you got stuck..."

4. How to Advance:
   - Look for a [new demanding job](https://thedailywtf.com/articles/Up-or-Out-Solving-the-IT-Turnover-Crisis) once you feel you have learned all you can and you don't see upwards mobility.
     - Make sure to [interview them](https://automationadmin.com/2016/04/interview-questions/) more than they interview you :)
     - Try to give your current position 3 years minimum, it can look bad if you jump ship too often.
   - Try to never be the smartest person the room
     - I'm a fan of skills checklists so that I'm always learning something new, see above.
   - Be a tinker by nature:
     - When you install programs, do you modify the themes, settings, sync options, encryption options? See my [tweaks](https://automationadmin.com/tags/#tweaks) tag for example. For example, it drives me crazy that people install vscode and don't know about `settings.json` [tweaks and extensions](https://github.com/gerryw1389/gerryw1389.github.io/blob/main/assets/code/vscode/settings-sync.json).
     - Do you regularly go out of your way to learn how $x works? See [this list](https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted) of things you can install in your [homelab](https://automationadmin.com/tags/#test-lab).
       - See my [setup](https://automationadmin.com/tags/#setup) tag for example.
       - After you stand something up, take notes of each step and then post them on [a blog](https://automationadmin.com/2019/06/wordpress-to-jekyll/) so you can showcase your skills.
         - This can be a self hosted Wordpress instance or preferably, Github Pages with many blog links pointing to your Github repos.
     - Last but not least, focus mostly on [scripting](https://automationadmin.com/2020/02/importance-of-learning-scripting/). I would do powershell for Windows and bash/python for linux servers.
       - I always explain scripting to be like legos - Super small chunks of things that you learn that build the foundation for any kind of automation you can think of. If you are interested in learning I would suggest Powershell or Python (or both)
         - See [this post on powershell](https://automationadmin.com/2018/02/new-to-powershell/).
         - See [this post on python](https://automationadmin.com/2020/11/new-to-python).
       - You will never not have an in-demand job if you know how to write scripts, especially if built on a SysAdmin foundational knowledge (how to build servers, how to [picture networking](https://automationadmin.com/2020/08/basic-network-troubleshooting), how to use [orchestration tools](https://automationadmin.com/tags/#orchestration) for example)
   - Work on your [people skills](https://automationadmin.com/2016/05/people-skills/) yo!
