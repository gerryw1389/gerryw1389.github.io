### To Resolve:

1. RDP to the server and open Task Manager. Check current usage stats. Open `Resmon` (Run => `resmon`) and let it run for a little bit, monitor results.

3. Open Perfmon and create a Data Collector Set  
   - Data Collector Sets - User Defined => New => Name it  
   - Choose Create from Template => System Performance => Finish the wizard using common judgement.  
   - At the end, choose &#8220;Open Properties&#8221;  
   - Go to Schedule Tab and set the schedule to the time the user said the issue was.
