### Description:

If you ever register for a GitHub account or somewhere to store your scripts to be shared, it is best practice to license your work, even if you don't plan to have any restrictions on it. I always choose the MIT license that only requires that you include the license file with your work. Other Open Source licenses can be found here.

### To Resolve:

1. Copy and paste the following to a licenses.txt file to include with your project:

The MIT License (MIT)

NOTE: Another license worth looking into is the [Creative Commons Non-Commercial](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)
