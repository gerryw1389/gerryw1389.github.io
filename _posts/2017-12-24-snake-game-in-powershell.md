### Description:

Remember the old snake game you used to play on your flip phone? I found a post the other day where someone was able to create that game in Powershell! [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/6wtlsc/i_wrote_a_snake_game_in_powershell_requires/?st=jbkb7zo9&sh=f75a7d2c).
