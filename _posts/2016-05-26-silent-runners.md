### Description:

&#8220;Silent Runners&#8221; to me are applications that I have running in my system tray or as extensions for my web browser. By all means, make your own list, but here is mine:

### Sys Tray:

1. Zemana Anti-Keylogger => An application that helps protect against keyloggers.

2. Unchecky => Automatically unchecks third party add-ons during installs.

3. Quick Cliq => Personalization application. I use it as a single key press application launcher.

4. Greenshot => Great screen shot utility.

### Chrome Extensions:

1. uBlock Origin => Open source ad blocker.

2. Ad Guard Block => Ad blocker.

3. Ghostery => Privacy extension

4. WOT => Web of Trust. Shows icons next to links letting you know if they are trusty or not.

5. LastPass => Password manager of choice.

6. Most of the above will have Firefox ports as well. Go to the Firefox Add ons site to search/install
