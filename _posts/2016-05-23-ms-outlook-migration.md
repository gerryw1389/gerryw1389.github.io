### Description:

If you want to move Outlook from one workstation to another, follow these steps.

### To Resolve:

1. Backup your &#8220;.pst&#8221; file.

2. On the new workstation, copy those files to the same directory and make sure you rename it to something unique. Start Outlook, go through the prompts of setting up a new email, this will create a new &#8220;.pst&#8221; default file => that's okay.

3. Once setup, go ahead and go to File => open => and open your old &#8220;.pst&#8221; file. Outlook will populate it in it's list of accounts.

4. Go to Account Settings => Click on your email account => Change Folder => change it to your old account's name and your done. Delete the default account completely.
