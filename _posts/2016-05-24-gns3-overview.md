### Description:

GNS3 is a virtual network software. You add nodes to a virtual network and find out about their interfaces in real time.

### To Resolve:

1. Run the AIO (All-in-one) installer from their website on the computer of your choice. I chose a Server 2012 Standard VM, but it should work on a client OS as well. NOTE: This installs over ten programs. Make sure to download binaries for the routers you plan to virtualize by downloading using Google &#8220;cisco binaries for gns3&#8221; or &#8220;index of ios parent directory bin&#8221;.

2. Before starting, make sure to open up the guide here. When you start GNS3, the first thing you want to do is go to Edit => Preferences => Dynamips => IOS Routers => and add the router files there.

3. Once that is completed you should see a router icon on your left navigation pane. From there, you drag and drop it into the center stage area for you to work with it. I usually just &#8220;start&#8221; the router and then &#8220;console&#8221; into it.

4. Now comes the fun part, learning how to use each of these! This is as far as I will go for now as I haven't gotten to focus too much into this just yet :
