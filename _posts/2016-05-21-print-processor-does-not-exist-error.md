### Description:

Usually after troubleshooting, you may somehow end up with an error that states &#8220;Print Processor Does Not Exist&#8221;.

### To Resolve:

1. Run => `C:\Windows\System32\spool\prtprocs\`

2. Make sure that the &#8220;winprint.dll&#8221; file is there, if not => copy the entire folder from another machine.

3. If it still does not work, Run => regedit.

4. Navigate to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments\Windows NT x86 (or Windows x64 if a 64bit OS) \Print Processors\winprint`.

5. On the &#8220;Driver&#8221; REG_SZ key, make sure it has the value of `winprint.dll`
