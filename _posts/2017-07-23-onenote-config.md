### Description:

My OneNote settings

### To Resolve:

1. Sign in to my MS Account

2. File => Options:

   - General = Verdana, 12pt.
   - Place OneNote icon in the notification area of the taskbar = Unchecked
   - Display = Pages appears on left
   - Sync = Both checked
   - Backup Notebooks stored on Sharepoint = Unchecked

3. Page templates:

   - Set tree and notes to the &#8220;green&#8221; color. Set the title to &#8220;New Page&#8221; and then just write &#8220;text&#8221; in the body. Save this as a template.

   - Right click the first page in each section and go to templates and apply that template for the section. This allows me to use the same template across my notebook.

4. Here is my [OneNote Template](https://github.com/gerryw1389/powershell/blob/master/Other/misc/onenote-template.zip)
