### To Resolve:

1. Check Windows Explorer and you will see padlock icons on the files, this means the files are individually encrypted using EFS

   - You can see this in the parent folder's properties:

   <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5527" src="https://automationadmin.com/assets/images/uploads/2018/08/efs-2.png" alt="" width="414" height="424" srcset="https://automationadmin.com/assets/images/uploads/2018/08/efs-2.png 414w, https://automationadmin.com/assets/images/uploads/2018/08/efs-2-293x300.png 293w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" /> 

2. You will need to uncheck the box and follow the prompts for un-encrypting the data. You may not find this as often anymore and most people moved on Bitlocker.
