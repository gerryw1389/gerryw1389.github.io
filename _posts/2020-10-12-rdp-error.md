### Description:

After getting a high DPI monitor, I wasn't able to use both screens when using RDP from W10 Enterprise to w10 Pro, I would get:

```escape
[Window Title]
Remote Desktop Connection

[Content]
Because of a protocol error (code: 0x112f), the remote session will be disconnected.
Please try connecting to the remote computer again.
```

### To Resolve:

1. The fix was to go to `Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Remote Desktop Services\Remote Desktop Session Host\Remote Session Environment` and `Configure compression for remoteFX data` then set it to `Balances memory and network bandwidth` on the destination computer.
