### Description:

If you are trying to open a file or an attachment in any of the Microsoft Office programs, you can get numerous error messages all related to &#8220;Protected View&#8221;.

### To Resolve:

1. Open MS Word => File => Settings => Trust Center => Protected View => Uncheck all.

2. Only other option is to actually save the attachment (which saves as a .zip), unzip it, check the file properties and "unblock" the file.
