### Description:

After [downloading your context file](https://automationadmin.com/2022/05/azure-connect/) for an Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster, you have many ways of interacting with the cluster. I will show the two I'm most familiar with here.

### To Resolve:

1. If you haven't already, install `kubectl` and `k9s` on [your machine locally](https://automationadmin.com/2022/03/setup-work-laptop)

1. First we will cover [k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s) since it is a console program for interacting with clusters:

   - main commands:
   - `ctrl+a` / `:alias` => shows all reasources for a cluster
   - `:q` / `Ctrl+c` => quit
   - `:ctx` => shows context
   - `:node` => navigates to a resource like all nodes
   - `d` describe
   - `v` view
   - `e` edit
   - `l` logs
   - Reference all [cli options here](https://k9scli.io/topics/commands/)

1. From the k9s site:

   ```shell
   # List all available CLI options
   k9s help
   # Get info about K9s runtime (logs, configs, etc..)
   k9s info
   # Run K9s in a given namespace.
   k9s -n mycoolns
   # Run K9s and launch in pod view via the pod command.
   k9s -c pod
   # Start K9s in a non default KubeConfig context
   k9s --context coolCtx
   # Start K9s in readonly mode - with all modification commands disabled
   k9s --readonly
   ```

1. So that is a tool to get familiar with, but more important is to get familiar with [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/) 

   - First, let's look at context commands

   ```shell
   kubectl config view # Show Merged kubeconfig settings.
   kubectl config get-contexts                          # display list of contexts
   kubectl config current-context                       # display the current-context
   kubectl config use-context my-cluster-name           # set the default context to my-cluster-name
   ```

   - Get all deployments: `kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces=true`
   - Get all pods: `kubectl get pods -A`
   - Follow the link above and [this link](https://github.com/eon01/kubectl-SheetCheat) for a full list of commands. Only way to learn is to practice!

1. To Do: Use [kubelogin](https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin) for authentication without the `--admin` credentials. See [this post for details](https://blog.baeke.info/2021/06/03/a-quick-look-at-azure-kubelogin/).

1. List IAM roles at Resource level: `az role assignment list --scope /subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<resourcegroupname>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<acrname> -o table`

1. Attach Azure Container Registry (ACR) to AKS: `az aks update -n <myAKSCluster> -g <myResourceGroup> --attach-acr <acr-resource-id>`

1. Service principle used for AKS: `az aks show --resource-group <myResourceGroup> --name <myAKSCluster> --query servicePrincipalProfile.clientId -o tsv`

1. If in a test environment, stop the cluster after testing to save resources: `az aks stop --resource-group my-cluster-rg --name my-cluster`
