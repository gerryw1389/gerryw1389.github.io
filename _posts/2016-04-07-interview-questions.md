### Description:

Remember when you interview, you should be interviewing the place just as much as they are interviewing you. Questions I will usually ask in interviews.

### To Resolve:

1. General Questions:  
   - Why is this salary exempt? Do you regularly work more than 40 hours a week?  
   - What kind of hours will I be working?  
   - Will there be weekend hours? If so, how soon am I supposed to respond to issues? What priorities am I expected to respond to?  
   - What impact is it if I'm 5 minutes late? How about Dr. Appointments?  
   - Will travel ever be required?  
   - Do you support training expenses? I.E. Will I get reimbursed for working on my Master's degree? Certs?  
   - What is the dress code?  
   - How big is the team I will be working with?  
   - Is there upward mobility?  
   - How many tickets/ projects/ tasks does the average person handle/ manage in a day? When someone is behind how is that handled?  
   - Do most of the team meet up after work or is this a work go home group?

2. Technical:  
   - What kind of backup system do you use?  
   - Is this more of an admin job or a desktop support job?  
   - Will I be in charge of more than one site?  
   - Can I run custom powershell scripts? In QA first of course.  
   - How many servers?  
   - Who handles first level support?  
   - Is there WSUS? How do you handle Windows Updates?  
   - Is there MDT/WDS? How do you handle imaging?
