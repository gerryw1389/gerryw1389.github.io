### Description:

Follow this post to use Auzre Logic Apps instead of Power Automate to upload files to [School Data Sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/schooldatasync/set-up-your-sds-flow)

### To Resolve:

1. Source code is [here](https://github.com/gerryw1389/terraform-examples/tree/main/logic-apps/school-data-sync/school-data-sync.json)

2. Be sure to find/replace for `double open brackets` to set your own values. Also keep in mind I had to make many changes to sanitize it so it is just a general idea of how the Logic App will work, you might have to tweak it.
