### Description:

Sharepoint is a hosted OneDrive like application where you have a &#8220;site&#8221; that has a finite size and you create &#8220;libraries&#8221; similar to folders on a shared drive and give specific people access to specific libraries. The following steps are used in the admin portal to accomplish simple tasks:

### To Add A New User To Your Site:

### To Add A User To A Library:

1. Click on Library name => Library tab at top => Library Permissions => Grant Permissions => User name (search) => Add specific permissions = Check all but &#8220;Full Control&#8221; and &#8220;Admin&#8221;
