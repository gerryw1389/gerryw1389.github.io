### Description:

All computer techs should know how to do a clean boot, even if you haven't heard it named this, you have probably done this multiple times to resolve a computer issue. This is best done when you feel that you are having a software issue (not anything with the OS or hardware) that's causing a problem.

### To Resolve:

1. Boot the computer into Safe Mode. For most computers, this is `F8` on startup.

2. Run => `msconfig`

3. Go into the Services tab and check the Hide all Microsoft services checkbox and disable all the others.

4. Go to the Startup tab and disable all of them, regardless of what they are.

5. Click Apply and reboot the computer.
