### Description:

This is just a reference article to show your rights for re-imaging machines.

### To Resolve:

1. Download the pdf from (search engine: "microsoft reimaging rights")

2. Essentially, OEM images are NOT allowed to be transferred from the machine to anything.

3. If you buy at least one volume license key, you can reimage machines on your network. Many people buy MAK (Multiple Activation Keys) with &#8220;seats&#8221; and image computers with the number allowed.

4. Two good references for re-imaging can be found on the Spiceworks HowTo's [here](https://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/124056-reimaging-rights-for-windows-10-licensing-how-to) and [here](https://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/114225-properly-license-a-windows-desktop-os-to-image-and-deploy).
