### Description:

Recently, MS has been releasing multiple updates that have caused issues with Office 2010. Here are some common symptoms:

QAT (quick access toolbar) greyed out = KB3114560  
Outlook only loading default settings = KB3114560  
Outlook only opening in Safe Mode = KB3114409

### To Resolve:

1. Uninstall the KB's related to the issues to resolve.

2. As always, after uninstalling the specific updates make sure to check for updates and hide them so they don't install again.
