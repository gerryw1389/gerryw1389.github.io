### Description:

The AntiVirus check will be failing it's check to the dashboard. This happens when the AntiVirus definitions are out of date and mostly happen when the customer doesn't renew their subscription with the provider.

### To Resolve:

2. If needed, you may have to end the GUI or System Tray process and restart the AV Software for the agent to recognize the update.

3. If it's still failing after the AV software has been updates, restart the &#8220;Advanced Monitoring Agent&#8221; service.
